# Cloak Of Darkness in GAC for the BBC Micro 
[**Cloak Of Darkness**](https://mipmip.org/IFrescue/rf/) is the de-facto standard demo of a text adventure game or work of interactive fiction (IF). Cloak Of Darkness is implemented here in [Graphic Adventure Creator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_Adventure_Creator) ([GAC](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=376034#p376034)) for the 8-bit BBC Micro computer.

GAC was originally developed by [Sean Ellis](https://www.skeptic.org.uk/2020/11/sean-ellis-1966-2020/) (1966-2020). RIP. ([General instructions](https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?p=376034#p376034) for using the BBC Micro version of GAC are available.)

Cloak Of Darkness was originally designed and implemented (in other IF systems) by [Roger Firth](https://www.ifwiki.org/Roger_Firth).


## The files

***CloakOfDarknessGAC.ssd*** is a bootable disc-image file in Acorn DFS format that can be used with a real BBC Micro computer or with a BBC Micro emulator such as BeebEm or JSBeeb. If you boot the disc-image and run the GAC adventure editor, you'll be able to load, view and edit the file CLOAK, which contains all the data for the game (with the exception of the number of the Starting Room, which is 4).

***printout.txt*** is a file containing the implementation details of the game, exported via the Print menu in the BBC Micro version of GAC, and edited slightly.
