240  What now?...

241  You can't. 

242  Pardon? 

243  Press a key for another game...

244  Are you sure? (Y/N)...

245  You've already got that. 

246  You haven't got that. 

247  You can't see that. 

248  You're carrying too much to pick that up.

249  Your score was

251  It is dark. You cannot see. 

252  I can't find that anywhere. 

253   You can also see: 

254  Okay 

255   turns.

1    You've only just arrived, and besides, the weather outside seems to be getting worse.

3    > A basic IF demonstration <

4    The message, neatly marked in the sawdust, reads, "YOU HAVE WON!" 

5    The message has been carelessly trampled, making it difficult to read. You can just distinguish the words "YOU HAVE LOST!" 

6    This isn't the best place to leave a smart cloak lying around.

7    You are carrying nothing.

8    A handsome cloak, of velvet trimmed with satin, and slightly splattered with raindrops. Its blackness is so deep that it almost seems to suck light from the room.

9    In the dark? You could easily disturb something.

11   On the wall is fixed a small brass hook.

12   On the wall is fixed a small brass hook on which a cloak is hanging.

13   Taking an inventory of possessions reveals that the player is wearing a black velvet cloak which, upon examination, is found to be light-absorbent. The player can drop the cloak on the floor of the Cloakroom or,better, put it on the hook. 

14   Returning to the Bar without the cloak reveals that the room is now lit. A message is scratched in the sawdust on the floor. The message reads either "You have won" or "You have lost", 

15   depending on how much it was disturbed by the player while the room was dark. The act of reading the message ends the game. And that's all there is to it...

1    Foyer of the Opera House. You are standing in a spacious hall, splendidly decorated in red and gold, with glittering chandeliers overhead. The entrance from the street is to the north, and there are doorways south and west.

2    Foyer Bar. The bar, much rougher than you'd have guessed after the opulence of the foyer to the north, is completely empty. There seems to be some sort of message scrawled in the sawdust on the floor.

3    Cloakroom. The walls of this small room were clearly once lined with hooks, though now only one remains. The exit is a door to the east.

4    Hurrying through the rainswept November night, you're glad to see the bright lights of the Opera House. It's surprising that there aren't more people about but, hey, what do you expect in a cheap demo game...?
